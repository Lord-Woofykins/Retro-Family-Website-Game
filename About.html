        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            Retro Family is a web based stratergy game, with the goal of
            paying off your debt. You are
            a soul, one that can hop between the bodies of the father and the son
            in order to gain different permissions and attributes.<br><br>
            Upon starting, you will be faced with a begin window, press the begin
            button to open the dashboard. (The begin window was used because it was easier
            than keeping track of events and buttons that would lead to the homepage). You will then be
            presented with multiple options depending on the TOD(time of day). The TOD dictates
            what player is avaiable to be played and represents a day night cycle of 3 phases.
            <br><br>
            The child will be preselected during the morning or lunchtime, but in the afternoon
            the option to play as the father will become available, this comes with the ability to
            access the physical stores no matter what, and gives access to the loans and balance.
            Note: the child can only use cash, but the father can choose whether to pay in
            cash or card. (This was never added because I ran out of time).
            <br><br>
            In the stores the prices will be the same for the day, and change evertime a new day is started. This is done to add stratergy
            and 
            <br><br>
            Custom Features: Time of day (different things accessible depending on time and saved prices each day), multiple characters (soul transfer).
        </p>
        <h2>Nodes</h2>
        <p>
            The nodes in my game are the stores, and there are two types: <br><br>
            The physical stores, which are mainly only accessible to the father. <br>
            The online stores, which are accessible to everyone.
            <br><br>
            These are just like the nodes in computer networks that have a series of 
            webpages and parts of the website.
        </p>
        <h2>Connections</h2>
        <p>
            The connections between the nodes are the buttons that take you from
            one node to another. These are cleary laid out for all of the stores on the dashboard, and others connections
            are seen throughout the sites to ensure accessibility. 
            <br><br>
            The way that these mirror links that you would find in sites is the same,
            there would be buttons, links and other ways of connecting the pages together.
        </p>
        <h2>Protocols</h2>
        <p>
            The rules in my game are dictated in the javascript, different things happen based on the
            way that the code is written, and the rules of how to play give the user an understanding of how
            to interpret and interact with informtion presented by the website. The websites are using the http protocol as well,
            using it to standardise the way that information is sent and recieved.
            <br><br>
            These mirror protocols just like how the websites communicate with the devices,
            the game is communicating with the player using a set of rules to interact and send information
            between the two. On the internet, HTTPS is used to protect data transfers from being eavesdropped on, 
            and attacked by malicious actors.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Movement</h2>
        <p>
            Data movement is facilitated through the use of variables, and using storages and manipulating the data to
            change the value of the balance when interacted with for example shows how data is manipulated and transferred between the storages and html files.
            <br><br>
            These can be then compared to the complex flows of data across the internet, and while my representation
            is very basic, it represents a small piece of the communications and manipulations of data performed to communicate with
            devices.
        </p>
        <h2>HandShake</h2>
        <p>
            The handshake in my game is the point of transaction for example, when the money value is exchanged
            for the quantity value, there is a handshake between the two nodes exchanging information. Another example is the process of
            withdrawing money from the balance into the cash, in this case there is an exhange of information and the two values are changed in accordance with
            the values inputted by the user.
        </p>
        <h2>Servers</h2>
        <p>Servers are where information is stored, and the website is run off of. In my case the server is being hosted by my laptop,
            and any values that are stores are either saved in memory or the ssd depending on the use case. Servers are vital to any website
            because they are where the calculations are performed, and all of the information is held, meaning that they hold a massive responsibility in managing the
            data.
            <br><br>
            Across the internet, websites are hosted off of remote servers, which are then used by accessing them remotely via the internet, and through this
            we are able to access their vast computing capabilities and information stored remotely and conveniently.
